Claude Code introduced a Workflow feature for orchestrating multi-agent steps, parallel branches, and pipelines as executable scripts. OpenWorkflows turns that pattern into a visual, multi-model editor: build one Workflow graph, then run or adapt it across Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, and future local or cloud model runtimes.

The shared IR keeps workflow structure portable while letting each node choose its runtime-facing model, prompt, schema, and execution settings.

## Usage Tutorial

- [OpenWorkflows usage tutorial](app/doc/claude-code-workflow-openworkflow.en.md) - step-by-step walkthrough from General settings and AI-input runtime selection to blueprint generation, running, and appearance switching.

## Multi-Model Workflow Support

- OpenWorkflows extends the Claude Code Workflow idea beyond a single LLM runtime.
- The same Workflow graph can be edited visually and targeted at Claude Code, Codex, Gemini, or additional adapters.
- Claude Code-style primitives such as agent steps, parallel branches, and pipelines become portable graph nodes.
- Each node can carry its own prompt, model tier, schema, and execution settings.
- The script view compiles the graph into runnable Claude Code-style Workflow scripts today, with the adapter layer ready for other model runtimes.

## Why OpenWorkflows

- Describe the goal in the bottom-right AI input and generate an editable Workflow blueprint.
- Visual workflow authoring instead of hand-editing large multi-agent scripts.
- A reusable prompt library with common workflow rewrites and review prompts.
- Workspace and session history so you can return to earlier work quickly.
- Run/stop controls with per-node execution state on the canvas.
- Local API key storage for browser-side AI assist, kept on the machine only.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd app
npm install
npm run dev
```

For the desktop app:

```bash
cd app
npm run desktop
```

For a Windows release package:

```bash
cd app
npm run package
```

From the repository root, `run.bat` launches the app and rebuilds when needed, and `build.bat` packages the Windows installer.

## Basic Usage

1. Create a new workflow or open an existing one.
2. Describe the task in the bottom-right AI input. OpenWorkflows generates the Workflow blueprint automatically.
3. Keep refining the blueprint by typing follow-up instructions in the same input, or click common prompts on the right panel for structure, completeness, cost, reliability, and rollback-oriented edits.
4. Select individual nodes when you need to manually edit prompts, models, schemas, or execution parameters.
5. Pick a runtime adapter such as Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini, then tune node models as needed.
6. Click the top Run button to execute the workflow, watch per-node status updates, and stop at any time.
7. Switch sessions or workspaces from the history rail to continue earlier work.
