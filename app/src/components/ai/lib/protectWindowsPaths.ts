/**
 * CONTRACT: protectWindowsPaths(md) -> md with Windows path backslashes doubled.
 *
 * CommonMark treats a backslash before ASCII punctuation as an escape and drops
 * it (`\.` -> `.`, `\(` -> `(`). A Windows path such as
 * `E:\UltraGameStudio\.ultragamestudio\clipboard-images\shot.png` therefore renders as
 * `E:\UltraGameStudio.ultragamestudio\clipboard-images\shot.png` — the `\.` segment loses its
 * separator, so the resulting file chip points at a path that does not exist and
 * the in-app preview fails to open. (Clipboard images always live under `\.ultragamestudio\`,
 * so every pasted screenshot path hits this.)
 *
 * This pure pre-pass finds Windows-style path tokens (drive-letter `X:\…` and
 * UNC `\\server\…`) outside code regions and doubles their backslashes. CommonMark
 * then collapses each `\\` back to a single literal `\`, so the chip and preview
 * see the original path. Code fences and inline code are masked out first because
 * backslashes there are already literal and must not be touched.
