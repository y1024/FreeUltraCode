/**
 * CONTRACT: headless run-engine interfaces shared by the desktop GUI and the
 * future Node CLI.
 *
 * The run engine lives in `runtime/` and is *pure* with respect to its host: it
 * never imports React / Zustand / Tauri and never touches `window`,
 * `document`, or `localStorage`. Every UI side effect (node colouring, message
 * stream, streaming progress, interaction, cancellation) is delegated to an
 * injected {@link RunCallbacks}. Every host capability the engine needs to reach
 * a model (direct HTTP completion, CLI subprocess spawn, gateway-route
 * resolution, speed/timeout heuristics) is injected through {@link RunGateway}
 * inside {@link RunContext}.
 *
 * The desktop GUI implements these against Zustand state + the Tauri spawn
 * seam (`aiEditViaCli`); the Node CLI will implement them against stdout/stderr
 * + `child_process`. Both consume the SAME `runtime/` code, so the observable
 * run behaviour is identical.
